‚ú® üëã Hi Everyone üëã ‚ú®

So in this time I want to share another project with you, previously I shared a project about the Laravel website, now we are looking for something different, now I want to share a project about games. The game project that I will share has a theme about learning mathematics, there are 3 stages in this game.


There are several types of characters in this game, as can be seen below :


<table width="100%" border=0 align="center">
    <tr>
        <td align="center" colspan=3>
        ~~ Character Preview ~~
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center" valign="middle">
        <td>
            Image
        </td>
        <td>
            Type
        </td>
        <td>
            Link Source
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center">
        <td>
            <img width="40%" alt="screen shot 2017-08-07 at 12 18 15 pm" src="ImgShow/character/mc.png">
        </td>
        <td>
            Main Character (player)
        </td>
        <td>

        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center">
        <td>
            <img width="35%" alt="screen shot 2017-08-07 at 12 18 15 pm" src="ImgShow/character/slime.png">

        </td>
    </tr>

        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center">
        <td>
            <img width="15%" alt="screen shot 2017-08-07 at 12 18 15 pm" src="ImgShow/character/zombie.png">

        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center">

            <img width="40%" alt="screen shot 2017-08-07 at 12 18 15 pm" src="ImgShow/character/monster.png" style="border-radius:10px">
        </td>
        <td>
            Monster (enemy)
        </td>
        <td>
            <a href="https://marwamj.itch.io/2d-monster-character">Marwa MJ (2017) </a>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

Now you can see a preview of what the game project will look like ...
</br>
<br>
<table width="100%" border=0>
    <tr>
        <td align="center" colspan=3>
        ~~ Gameplay Preview ~~
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center" >
        <td>
            <br>
                <img width="100%" alt="screen shot 2017-08-07 at 12 18 15 pm" src="ImgShow/gameplay/2.png" style="border-radius:10px">
            </br>
        </td>
        <td>
            <br>
                <img width="100%" alt="screen shot 2017-08-07 at 12 18 15 pm" src="ImgShow/gameplay/3.png" style="border-radius:10px">
            </br>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center" >
        <td colspan=2>
            <br>
                <img width="90%" alt="screen shot 2017-08-07 at 12 18 15 pm" src="ImgShow/gameplay/1.png" style="border-radius:10px">
            </br>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


Note :
-

I made this project using the <b>Unity3d Free license software.</b> You can run this project with <b>Unity Editor version "2021.3.23f1".</b> If you use a version that is above it, it should be fine, but I recommend using the same version to avoid conflicts or errors. But if you want to try a different version that's fine.
Good luck... ‚ú®‚úå

If you want to try the game first before opening the project, you can download the game.apk file in the "Demo_App" folder that I have provided.

‚ú® You can use other people's work to learn but you cannot claim other people's work ‚ú® <br>I hope this project can help you, see you next time... ‚ú®‚úå
